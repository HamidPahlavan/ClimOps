<h7>Course project for CSE 583 - Software Engineering for Data Scientists</h7>

<h2> Project description </h2>

This project will create a data set that allows researchers to explore whether there is a correlation between beliefs about climate change,
and demographic characteristics and transportation behaviors reported in the United States Census.
The final product would allow the user to explore (through basic statistics and visualizations) questions such as:
<li> Are race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (education and income), and gender correlated with climate change perceptions?</li>
<li> Do people’s beliefs about climate change have a correlation with their transportation behavior
  (for example, do people who believe that climate change is happening and caused by humans drive less/ own less cars/ use more public transit/ bike more)?.</li>

<br>
The goal is to create an easy way to visualize potential relationships between these data sets to see if any of these may worth exploring further.
<br>
<br>

<h2> Sources of data </h2>
This project combines the following data sets:

<li> The 2018 Yale Climate Opinions Map Data</li>
<li> The 2015 United States Census</li>

<h2> Use case: </h2>

<li> Reveal relationship between a specific climate opinion question and a demographic variable.</li>
<br>
<h3> Heatmap:</h3>
This figure shows the correlation, regression, and p values between demographic variables (y-axis) and climate opinion questions (x-axis) as a heatmap.
<li><b>What is a heatmap?</b></li>
A representation of data in the form of a map in which data values are represented as colors.
</br>
<li><b>What is correlation coefficient?</b></li>
Correlation coefficient is a statistical association indicates how close two variables are to having a linear relationship with each other. 
It assume values in the range from −1 to +1, where +1 indicates the strongest possible agreement and −1 the strongest possible disagreement.
A value of zero indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables.
</br>
<li><b>What is regression coefficient?</b></li>
Regression coefficient represents the mean change in the response variable (i.e. YCOM) for one unit of change in the predictor variable (i.e. census).
The key to understanding this coefficient is to think of it as slope, and it's often called slope coefficient.
