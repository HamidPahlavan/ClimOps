Climate opinion maps
===================
1. This project will create a data set that allows researchers to explore whether a relationship exists between beliefs about climate change, demographic characteristics and transportation behaviors (for example walking, cycling, driving behaviors, use of transit types and number of cars owned) in the United States.
2. The final product would allow the user to explore (through basic statistics and visualizations) questions such as:
■ Do race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status (education and income), and gender is related to climate change perceptions?
■ Do people’s beliefs about climate change have a relationship with their transportation behavior (for example, do people who believe that climate change is happening and caused by humans drive less/ own less cars/ use more public transit/ bike more?.
■ How public opinion about global warming changed relative to 2014 and we want to see if this change is related to other data ( e.g., census)
